# Project 2 Report
##BadSmell Detector

##  1. Collection

Data was collected using Python scripts.
We started with the intial file given for the study gitable.py and began to build from there.
Using this file as a starter we were able to define other features to extract and allowed us to get acclimated to using the Github API, JSON, and how to write good Python code.
The code created for each feature can be found in a single python file.
The features are divided amongst folder and the data for the three repositories are listed in the feature results folder under their aliases(as assigned by us).


## 2. Anonymized
 To anonymize the data we created a python script that collects the repository specific information(contributors, milestones, etc.) and creates a dictionary linking to those values.
 This dictionary is created for each repository. 
 We created a shell script that then for that specific organization it goes into the result files and pulls all the identifying information out and replaces it with aliases.
